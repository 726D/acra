## Implementing an extension
Create a class extending one of the supported interfaces. 

It has to be `public` and have a zero-argument public constructor (as a result, it cannot be an inner class).

Example:

<AndroidCode>

```kotlin
MyAdmin : ReportingAdministrator {
    init {
        Log.d("MyAdmin", "MyAdmin was loaded")
    }
}
```

```java
public MyAdmin implements ReportingAdministrator {
    public MyAdmin() {
        Log.d("MyAdmin", "MyAdmin was loaded");
    }
}
```

</AndroidCode>

| Supported Extensions | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| [`Collector`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/collector/Collector.html) | Collect additional custom data not covered by acra |
| [`ApplicationStartupCollector`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/collector/ApplicationStartupCollector.html) | Collector which is also called at startup |
| [`ReportInteraction`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/interaction/ReportInteraction.html) | Usually not needed, as the provided options (dialog, notification, toast) cover all reasonable choices |
| [`ReportingAdministrator`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/config/ReportingAdministrator.html) | Control when reports are generated and when the application should be stopped |
| [`ReportSenderFactory`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/sender/ReportSenderFactory.html) | Register custom report senders |
| [`ConfigurationBuilderFactory`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/config/ConfigurationBuilderFactory.html) | Register custom configurations |
| [`SenderSchedulerFactory`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/scheduler/SenderSchedulerFactory.html) | Register custom sender scheduler, e.g. to prevent report sending based on custom conditions |
| [`StartupProcessor`](https://www.acra.ch/javadoc/latest/org/acra/startup/StartupProcessor.html)  | Do something ACRA related on app start |
## Registering an extension
Choose one of the following alternatives:
### By annotation

Add the following dependencies:
<GradleCode>

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
compileOnly("com.google.auto.service:auto-service-annotations:1.0")
annotationProcessor("com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.0")
```

```groovy title="build.gradle"
compileOnly "com.google.auto.service:auto-service-annotations:1.0"
annotationProcessor "com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.0"
```

</GradleCode>

Then annotate your extension with the following:

<AndroidCode>

```kotlin
@AutoService(<ExtensionInterface>::class)
```

```java
@AutoService(<ExtensionInterface>.class)
```

</AndroidCode>

### By file
See [ServiceLoader](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) for manual service registration
